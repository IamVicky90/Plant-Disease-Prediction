  ## Overview
This is a simple image classification Flask app trained on the top of Keras API. The trained model (`https://github.com/IamVicky90/Plant-Disease-Prediction/blob/main/Model/Various%20Plant%20Disease%20Detection%20Model1.h5`) takes an image (from Plant Disease) as an input and predict the class of image from __diseased cotton leaf, diseased cotton plant, fresh cotton leaf, fresh cotton plant, Pepper bell Bacterial spot, Pepper bell healthy, Potato Early blight, Potato healthy, Potato Late blight, Tomato Target Spot, Tomato Tomato mosaic virus, Tomato Tomato YellowLeaf Curl Virus, Tomato Bacterial spot, Tomato Early blight, Tomato healthy, Tomato Late blight, Tomato Leaf Mold, Tomato Septoria leaf spot, Tomato Spider mites Two spotted spider mite__ denomination.
